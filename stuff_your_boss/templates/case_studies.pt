		<h2>Case Study One</h2>

		<p>A worker at a glazing firm in Monkseaton, on the outskirts of Newcastle Upon Tyne, approached Newcastle Solfed for assistance  in obtaining weeks worth of unpaid wages. After her employer palmed her off with empty promises.</p>

		<p>After realising that neither the legal route, nor endless personal appeals to her boss were going to get her anywhere, this worker called upon the SolFed. Weeks had passed and there was clearly no intention from this employer to pay a single penny of what he owed.</p>

		<p>Upon approaching Newcastle SolFed, the worker was given a chance to explain exactly what had happened and what was owed. Together, SolFed and the worker discussed various possible actions, the pros and cons of each, and formulated a thoughtful plan of action. It was decided that an escalating campaign would be launched, with regular contact scheduled between the worker and SolFed to assess how things were going and adapt if necessary.</p>

		<p>Before the campaign started, the employer was sent a letter from SolFed outlining the situation and expressing that unless the monies were paid promptly, a campaign involving leafleting, picketing and eventual publicising in the media would begin. It was made clear that the campaign would not desist until the worker was paid for her labour, fair and square. The employer did not deny the money owed and merely contacted the SolFed with a warning not to continue. Of course, this was water off a duck’s back and after another letter confirming that action would indeed be taking place and that until the debt was paid there would be no more contact from Solfed, the campaign was underway.</p>

		<p>The campaign started with low level flyering around the employer’s offices. The flyers were professional and polite whilst describing the injustice that the employee was suffering and encouraging the recipients to avoid using the glaziers until the matter was resolved. Furthermore, patrons were invited to visit the offices and complain about the ill treatment of the staff.</p> 

		<p>Although he still refused to pay, this tactic obviously unsettled the company owner as several messages were received from him and his sidekick the following day, ordering the Solfed to desist. 
		A meeting was held with the worker to ensure she was still happy with the campaign and, true to their word, the Solfed did not respond to the avoidance tactics of this greedy boss. Two days later, the Solfed undertook a second round of leaflet dropping in the area around the glaziers, as well as sending a matching email around local businesses. A few more nasty messages were received from the employer the next morning, including one where he categorically stated the employee would “not ever see a penny of her wages” and that “the police were on their way”. Once again, this stalling was met with no response. </p>

		<p>After finally cottoning on that the Solfed would stick to their word and continue this escalating and campaign, and after realising that the actions of the Solfed were completely peaceful and legal, the employer finally offered to pay the employee the night after the second round of campaigning. Begging this man had got the employee nowhere, nor had threatening him with the law. But once he realised that he would lose face as his abusive position was exposed amongst potential customers, it only took a matter of days for this boss to pay the substantial outstanding earnings. </p>

		<p>After contacting the employee at around 10.30 at night, and desperate to avoid any further embarrassment, the employer paid the missing wages by bank transfer by 11pm. Fortunately, in this case the matter was concluded within a matter of days, and a four figure some of owed earnings was paid. If necessary, however, the Solfed would have continued and escalated the campaign, acting peacefully and within the law to expose the man in question. Boycotts, customer complaints and embarrassment would eventually force this slippery character to realise that it was better for his wallet and his reputation to do the right thing and pay his staff.

		The employee was amazed at how quickly direct action had been effective. Afterall, she had tried to deal with this problem on her own for some time. She has no doubt that without the intervention of Newcastle Solfed, she definitely would not have “ever seen a penny of her wages”.</p>

		<h2>Case Study Three</h2>

			<p>Unifying groups of workers in the hospitality industry that have had similar experiences of wage theft and poor working conditions, Brighton SolFed have started a campaign to further support workers in this industry with an initiative to build a union.</p>

			<p>Through hard work, they have promoted the union initiative, trained members using SolFed's Workplace Organiser training and gathered contacts using public stalls and distributing thousands of leaflets and posters. Having fought several battles of wage theft, the campaign has won every fight so far. It is still very early days for the campaign; their main support still comes from the SolFed Local, however as the union initiative builds membership they "would like actual hospitality workers to take over, become members, and organise from inside those shops, on a more permanent basis." SolFed see this as a paramount importance; we believe creating fighting unions controlled by the membership is ultimately more effective than supporting workers from the outside.</p>

			<p>Working as a collective and with the support of the Brighton Local and fellow workers in the hospitality industry, Brighton Hospitality Workers have won stolen pay running into many thousands.</p>

			<p>Uniting workers in the same industry is part of SolFed's strategy of fighting for ourselves; using direct action and bottom-up democracy to win these fights, allows workers to keep control of their own union.</p>

			<p>Not every fight is an easy fight, but always worth fighting. From a group of isolated, ripped-off workers, they have created a support network that has brought a sense of confidence and protection where there was none. As always, they have much to do and a long way to go, but remain an inspiration in showing us what can come about if enough of us stand up to crooked bosses.</p>
