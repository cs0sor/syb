		</div>

		<h3>Who we are</h3>
			<p>Newcastle Solidarity Federation (SolFed) is part of a national and international federation of radical anarcho-syndicalist unions. We support individuals and groups to organise in their places of work.</p>

		<h3>How we are different to other unions</h3>

			<p>The SolFed is an anarcho syndicalist union, all our campaigns and struggle are lead by those with the complaints. We organise from the bottom up and our politics are revolutionary. We will not sell you insurance and we do not insist that you join us, but if you do, you will be warmly welcomed. SolFed is about struggle and unity, being a member means being as active as possible - though we all have busy lives, we don't expect your soul! SolFed is not a mediator between bosses and workers - we always side with the workers and fight to win.</p>

		<h3>What we do</h3>

			<p>We specialise in the cases that other unions leave behind, and will show solidarity to all workers in struggle regardless of membership. SolFed has an excellent track record of winning case work and we will organise in areas where mainstream unions refuse to go. If you or anyone you know have a problem with your boss, get in touch. We are not a service who will fix things on your behalf, we always expect your involvement. We provide free advice and support based around your involvement, using direct action tactics, as well as free organiser training to help build your own workplace SolFed union. If you have a problem with your boss - give us a call!</p>
